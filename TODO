TODO:

* Don't save bad queries into the hashstack
* Add MRU to hashstack that works like a browser's back/foward
* If browsing via the table browser, set a table flag on the page
  so that it's easy to make foreign key requests with a given id.
  i.e., enter on a primary key should allow you to select a foreign
  key table
* Allow full screen mode
* Allow for filterable tables area
* Use <C-]> to move between foreign key fields
* Add object to handle the results/query/tables objects:
  * Results table
  * Results selected
  * Tables selected
  * Query etc
* SweetKeys contexts => go with binding on inputs/textareas or using
  namespaces as currently.
* Returning false inside a key combination should return false from the bind event (stop propagation)
* Better name for SweetKeys. KCombinator. KeyLock?

NICE:

* Move in blocks of 5 up and down with CTRL + D and CTRL + U
* Move to end of row with $ and beginning with 0 or ^


Keys:
* Usually applied to "keypress" event. Not normally done on "keyup" event
